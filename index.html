<h3 id="daytime">Daytime</h3>
<p>Players can vote during the night to set it to daytime.
Voting starts when the first player activates the command <strong>Dayplease</strong> (<em>or Daypls</em>) and will reset when it next becomes daytime.</p>
<h4 id="to-start-a-vote-simply-type">To start a vote simply type</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>/Dayplease <strong>or</strong> _/Dayplease Yes</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Players can vote from any world and can change their vote if they change their mind.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>/Dayplease No</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="night-time">Night-time</h3>
<p>Players can vote during the day to set it to night-time.
Voting starts when the first player activates the command <strong>Nightplease</strong> (<em>or Nightpls</em>) and will reset when it next becomes night-time.</p>
<h4 id="to-start-a-vote-simply-type-1">To start a vote simply type</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>/Nightplease</em> <strong>or</strong> <em>/Nightplease Yes</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just like the Daytime vote, players can vote from any world and can change their vote if they change their mind.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>/Nightplease No</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="daytime-and-night-time-voting">Daytime and Night-time voting</h4>
<p>Both votes requires a Yes from at-least half the players currently on the <strong>Overworld</strong> to change the time.
Players can query whether there is an on-going vote and how many votes it has by typing the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>/Dayplease Query</em>
<br /><em>/Nightplease Query</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="debugging">Debugging</h3>
<p>Players with the <em>daytimevote.canDebug</em> permission can enable / disable the plugins debug mode with the command <strong>DebugDaytimevote</strong> (<em>or /ddv</em>).
When debug mode is enabled debug messages will be sent to players with the <em>daytimevote.canDebug</em> permission as well as the console.</p>
<h4 id="to-enable--disable-debug-mode-type">To enable / disable debug mode type</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>/DebugDaytimevote Enable</em> <strong>or</strong> <em>/DebugDaytimevote Disable</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Players with permission can query whether debugging is enabled by typing the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>/DebugDaytimevote Query</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="modifying-the-config">Modifying the config</h3>
<p>Players with the <em>daytimevote.canChangeConfig</em> permission can modify the plugin’s config file with the command <strong>changeDaytimeVoteConfig</strong> (<em>or /cdvc</em>).
Players can change the calculation used to determine how many players are required to pass a vote or explicitly set the number.</p>
<h4 id="to-modify-the-number-of-required-votes-for-daytime--night-time">To modify the number of required votes for daytime / night-time</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>/changeDaytimeVoteConfig Day</em> <strong>or</strong> <em>/changeDaytimeVoteConfig Night</em> <strong>or</strong> <em>/changeDaytimeVoteConfig All</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Players with permission can query the currently saved settings by typing the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>/changeDaytimeVoteConfig Query</em></p>
</blockquote>
